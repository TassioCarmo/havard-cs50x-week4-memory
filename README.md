# Introduction to Memory

## What did i learn

Arrays, which were just chunks of memory back to back to back

## RGB

white, with R: 255, G: 255, and B: 255, and #FFFFFF
red, with R: 255, G: 0, and B: 0, and #FF0000
green, with R: 0, G: 255, and B: 0, and #00FF00
blue, with R: 0, G: 0, and B: 255, and #0000FF

## Hexadecimal

- decimal: 10^n
- Binary: 2^n
- Hexadecimal: 16^n

count from 0 to F

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F

F = 16

F     F = 255 

1111 1111 

```
16^1  16^0
#    #

A    9

16*10 + 1*9 = 169

```

hexadecimal is very useful when you want to treat data in units of four
in the world of memory, programming, people tend to count memory bytes using hexadecimal. Partly just by convention, but also partly because it's a little more succinct 

ny time you see 0x and then a number, that's by convention  signaling to the reader that this is in fact a hexadecimal number. So if it's 0x10, that is not the number 10, that is the hexadecimal number one zero. 


## Addresses, pointers
